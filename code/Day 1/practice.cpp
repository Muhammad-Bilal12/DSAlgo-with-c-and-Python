/* 
*Important Points to Note while Writing a C++ Program:

Always include the necessary header files for the smooth execution of functions. For example, <iostream> must be included to use std::cin and std::cout.
The execution of code begins from the main() function.
It is a good practice to use Indentation and comments in programs for easy understanding.
cout is used to print statements and cin is used to take inputs.
